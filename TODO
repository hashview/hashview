Tasks 
    - Create Task
        - Support Bruteforce task
        - Support combinator task
        - Support Bandril approach
        - Support for cewl
    - Task Edit

Taskgroups
    - List
        - Number of Tasks
    - Assign Tasks 
        - Allow for task creation at task assignment (why did i even allow this in the first place)
        - Does it make sense to put these in a form?
        - Dont allow for duplicate tasks to be assigned
    - Delete task_groups
        - Prevent Deletion if assigned to a Job

Jobs
    - Create Jobs
        - Assign existing Hashfiles
            - Exising Hashfile
                - Grey out tab if no pre-existing hashfile exists
            - New hashfiles
                - Select file format
                    - Give example (?) on mouse over
                - Select hash Type
                    - on other allow user to type in hashtype
                - After selecting Hash format, the hashtype menu should be restricted to only show those possible hashes. i.e. no NetNTLMv1->Kerberos
        - Assign Tasks
            - Should probably be a form :/
            - Remove task from assignable tasks that are already assigned to the job
            - redirect back to assign tasks if no tasks are assigned
        - Offer cancel button along the entire process
            - deletes jobtasks
            - delete job
            - redirects to joblist

Analytics
    - I think outerjoins should be .joins
    - Set color scheme to look good
    - download pngs
    - Total Hashes Cracked vs uncracked
    - Total unique cracked vs uncracked
    - Top 10 masks
    - Top 20 users per single hash/password
    - All duplicates?
    - Both Bar graphs should render widths dynamically
    - Show users based on matching hashes
    - show users based on matching cracked passwords

API
    - Update CPU/GPU count
    - update cracks with each checkin

Search
    - Do we even let the user pick which type, or just run queries on both?
    - Export Results
    - Expand search text box

Wordlists
    - Change wordlist path attribute in db to be relative to app install path
        - does this affect the path returned by the API to agents?

Dynamic Wordlists
    - Create manually for now
        - Name: All Recovered Hashes

Rules
    - Edit 
        - Rules in browser

Hashfiles
    - if > retention date Delete
        - delete Associated Jobs
        - if no other hashfiles exists for customer, delete customer
        
Login
    - Should be a card style

Settings
    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashes;

        - how to run on periodic basis?

Force settings population if unset

taskgroups / hashfiles should probably be renamed to task_groups and hash_files, word_lists?

Change dropdown alignment of jobs, tasks, manage (in templates/layout.html)

        - Associated Task_groups (same as above)
        - Associated Tasks (same as above)

Notifications
    - Optimize hashes object in notifications_list class/route.

All
    - change uri scheme to be consistent
        - jobs/id/status
        - jobs/delete/id
        - agents/delete/id

Standardize modals
    - info
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users
    - delete
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users

To Test:

    1) set forgot password
    2) attempt to login as the user prior to reset
    3) does it work?
    4) what happens if we request another token?

# Next Phase
General
    - Add ability for users / admins? to import plaintext's and auto convert to specific hashes
API
    - Turn into legit resful api using flask_restful / api
Jobs
    - Increase speed of importation of new hashes

profile -> pushover notification when null auto populates
update cracked hashes from agent to server. 

Update agent to stop downloading the same rules over and over again

filter imports for usernames that contain non english characters
filter rules file that contain non-english characters

Max runtime per job admin setting

Dynamic hashfile based on hashtype.

Prevent duplicate Notifications

show notification selection on table load if previously selected by the user

# COMPLETE BEFORE OPEN BETA
- Grey out pushover option in hash notifications
- Test if user can reset password to something < 14 chars long
- Sanity check when user submits invalid hashfile formats
- prevent job with no tasks.

Fix why agents keep asking for rules file
