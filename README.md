# Hashview v0.8.1

>**Hashview** is a tool for security professionals to help organize and automate the repetitious tasks related to password cracking. It is broken into two compoents, the Hashview Server, and Hashview Agent. The Hashview Server is a web application that manages one or more agents, deployed by you on dedicated hardware. (note you can run the server and agent on the same machine). Hashview strives to bring constiency in your hashcat tasks while delivering analytics with pretty pictures ready for ctrl+c, ctrl+v into your reports.

## Note: If you are running version v0.8.0 and want to upgrade. All you need to do is git pull on main and start hashview.py, this should automatically upgrade your instance to the latest version.

## Server Requirements

1. Python 3.7+ 
2. Mysql DB installed with known username/password   
3. Access to a SMTP email service (used for password resets and notifications)

## Agent Requirements

1. Python 3.7+
2. Hashcat 6.2.x+

## Installation
Follow these instructions to install Hashview Server on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS server. In theory Hashview should be able to run on any *nix system, but the dev's only installed/tested on Debian/Ubuntu.

### NEW ‚≠ê Docker Install
We now have a docker image available for Hashview. This is the easiest way to get Hashview up and running. 

1. Copy and update the .env.example file to .env
2. Run `docker-compose up` / `docker-compose up -d` to start the Hashview server
3. Navigate to https://localhost:8443
4. Login with your specified credentials


#### 1) Setup MySQL 

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo service mysql start
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

#### 2) Configure MySQL
Log into your mysql server and create a dedicated user for hashview. Hashview can run as root, but doesnt need to. And since we practice what we preach. we should use a lower priv account for this. If you're installing hashview on a different server than the system where the mysql db is running on, adjust the account creation.

```
sudo mysql
CREATE USER 'hashview'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'DoNotUseThisPassword123!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hashview.* TO 'hashview'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
create database hashview;
exit
```

#### 3) Install Hashview Server
The following are to install hashview after the mysql db has been setup.

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-flask
git clone https://github.com/hashview/hashview
cd hashview
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./setup.py
./hashview.py # (note you can add a --debug if you are attempting to troubleshoot an issue)
```

#### 4) Log into your hashview server
Navigate to your server, default port is 8443. https://IP:8443

(note)
Because hashview is installed with a self signed certificate, you will be prompted about it being invalid. You're welcome to use properly signed certs by replacing the files under `hashview/hashview/control/ssl/`

Once logged in, before you can start cracking hashes, you need to install a Hashview-Agent.

## Installing Hashview-Agent
After you've installed hashview you will need to install a hashview-agent. The agent can run on the same system as hashview, but doesn't have to.

#### 1) Log into hashview as an Administrator
#### 2) Navigate to Agents Menu
#### 3) Click Download Agent to get a .tgz package of the hashview-agent
#### 4) Move agent to the system you'd like to run it on
#### 5) Install Agent

You will need to decompress the package and run the `hashview-agent.py` script. Upon initial execution it will prompt you for information about your hashview server.
```
tar -xzvf hashview-agent.<version>.tgz
cd install/
cp -r hashview-agent ../
cd ../hashview-agent
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./hashview-agent.py
```

#### 6) Once running, you (or another admin) will need to navigate back into Hashview->Manage->agents and approve the agent.
