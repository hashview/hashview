Tasks 
    - Create Task
        - Support Bruteforce task
        - Support combinator task
        - Support Bandril approach
        - Support for cewl
    - Task Edit

Taskgroups
    - List
        - Number of Tasks
    - Assign Tasks 
        - Allow for task creation at task assignment (why did i even allow this in the first place)
        - Does it make sense to put these in a form?
        - Dont allow for duplicate tasks to be assigned
    - Delete task_groups
        - Prevent Deletion if assigned to a Job

Jobs
    - Create Jobs
        - Assign existing Hashfiles
            - Exising Hashfile
                - Grey out tab if no pre-existing hashfile exists
            - New hashfiles
                - Select file format
                    - Give example (?) on mouse over
                - Select hash Type
                    - on other allow user to type in hashtype
                - After selecting Hash format, the hashtype menu should be restricted to only show those possible hashes. i.e. no NetNTLMv1->Kerberos
        - Assign Tasks
            - Should probably be a form :/
            - redirect back to assign tasks if no tasks are assigned
        - Offer cancel button along the entire process
            - deletes jobtasks
            - delete job
            - redirects to joblist

Analytics
    - I think outerjoins should be .joins
    - Set color scheme to look good
    - download pngs
    - Total Hashes Cracked vs uncracked
    - Total unique cracked vs uncracked
    - Top 10 masks
    - Top 20 users per single hash/password
    - All duplicates?
    - Both Bar graphs should render widths dynamically
    - Show users based on matching hashes
    - show users based on matching cracked passwords

API
    - Update CPU/GPU count
    - update cracks with each checkin

Search
    - Do we even let the user pick which type, or just run queries on both?
    - Export Results
    - Expand search text box

Wordlists
    - Change wordlist path attribute in db to be relative to app install path
        - does this affect the path returned by the API to agents?

Rules
    - Edit 
        - Rules in browser

Hashfiles
    - if > retention date Delete
        - delete Associated Jobs
        - if no other hashfiles exists for customer, delete customer
        
Login
    - Should be a card style
    - Unauthed User Registration

    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashes;
    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashfile_hashes;
    - retention
        - set
        - validate
        - how to run on periodic basis?
    - Max runtime for jobs

Add favicon

taskgroups / hashfiles should probably be renamed to task_groups and hash_files, word_lists?

Change dropdown alignment of jobs, tasks, manage (in templates/layout.html)

All
    - change uri scheme to be consistent
        - jobs/id/status
        - jobs/delete/id
        - agents/delete/id
    - When all hashes are cracked, all active tasks should be killed

Standardize modals
    - info
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users
    - delete
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users

To Test:

    1) set forgot password
    2) attempt to login as the user prior to reset
    3) does it work?
    4) what happens if we request another token?

# Next Phase
General
    - Add ability for users / admins? to import plaintext's and auto convert to specific hashes
    - Support Domain Cached Credentials (hashtype 1100)
API
    - Turn into legit resful api using flask_restful / api
Jobs
    - Increase speed of importation of new hashes

profile -> pushover notification when null auto populates
update cracked hashes from agent to server. 

filter imports for usernames that contain non english characters
filter rules file that contain non-english characters

Dynamic hashfile based on hashtype.


show notification selection on table load if previously selected by the user

# COMPLETE BEFORE OPEN BETA
- Grey out pushover option in hash notifications
- Test if user can reset password to something < 14 chars long

Fix why agents keep asking for rules file
# Bug
Setup doesnt have ssl folder
need to generate ssl keys
setup doesnt create hashview db 

Analytics will show blank entries for top 10/password count by length as empty if password is blank.

Homepage agent status window (connected, disconnected, busy, etc)
support VERSION info being sent from agents to server
remove ability for user to select (other hashtype) when building job
