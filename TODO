    - Give ability to stop jobs / tasks

To Test:
    1) load two hashfiles for a single customer
    2) remove one hashfile
    3) both cracked/uncracked count of other hashfile should not be affected

    1) load three hashfiles, two for one customer a third for a second customer
    2) remove one hashfile
    3) remaining cracked/uncracked counts should not be affected

# Next Phase
- Add ability for users / admins? to import plaintext's and auto convert to specific hashes
API
    - Turn into legit resful api using flask_restful / api


User Registration/password reset broken
update pushover stuff on job
profile -> pushover notification when null auto populates
update cracked hashes from agent to server.
